# C abstract machine

- C does not run directly on the CPU
- it defines code behavior on a theoretical machine
- compiler maps the abstract behavior to the actual hardware
- each var in C refers to an obj
- object is a region of data storage big enough to hold a val of some type
- characteristics of objects:
    - type             => determines interpretation of bits
    - value            => stored data
    - lifetime         => when the obj exists in memory
    - storage duration => static, automatic and dynamic

- storage duration ==> automatics, static, thread, dynamic

- automatic storage duration - when control block entered - usually on the stack but can be optimized by the compiler to be put in a register.

- static duration  ==>  scope not bounded to lexical declaration location
    |--> it is retained in storage for the duration of the program

- if static declaration in a function ==> scope is limited to the local scope i.e. function but the duration is the whole execution time. No linkage at all
- if static in the global scope ==> scope is the translation unit with internal linkage so cannot be used inside a different c file.
- use extern to allow other translation units access to the obj.

- a regular global obj declaration has external linkage.
- only when static global decl --> internal linkage enforced.

- global static int is not inherently thread safe. 
- if read write by multiple threads then use mutex or atomic opers to ensure thread safety
